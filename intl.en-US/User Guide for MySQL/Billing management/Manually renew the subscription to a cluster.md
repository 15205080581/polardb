# Manually renew the subscription to a cluster {#concept_tpr_jqq_tdb .concept}

You can renew your subscription to clusters in the ApsaraDB for POLARDB console or in the renewal management console. In the renewal management console, you can renew your subscription to multiple clusters at the same time.

**Note:** Clusters that use the billing method of pay-as-you-go \(hourly rate\) do not involve expiration and renewal.

3.  Find the target cluster, click the **More** icon in the Actions column, and then click **Renew**.

## Enable automatic renewal {#section_jaq_119_mim .section}

After automatic renewal is enabled, you do not need to renew the subscription regularly. In addition, you can be free from service interruption caused by subscription expiration.
