# Feature updates {#concept_1198263 .concept}

This topic describes the feature updates of ApsaraDB for POLARDB.

**Note:** 

-   To use the latest features, you need to upgrade your clusters to the latest version. During the upgrade, services may be interrupted for about 60 seconds. Ensure that your applications apply reconnection policies so that the applications can automatically reestablish a connection to a cluster that was previously marked as down.
-   If the **Upgrade to Latest Version** button does not appear, your cluster is in the latest version.
