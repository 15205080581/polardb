# View the node performance diagnostics report {#concept_ibb_qyr_2gb .concept}

The diagnostics report lists the details and levels of the issues on a node and provides optimization suggestions. It allows you to fully understand the issues and optimize the node accordingly to improve the node performance. The diagnostics report includes the basic information, comprehensive performance score, status and issues of the core metrics, and Structured Query Language \(SQL\) statement analysis of the node. The core metrics include the central processing unit \(CPU\) usage, memory usage, storage usage, input/output operations per second \(IOPS\), and connections. This topic describes how to create and view the performance diagnostics report for a node.
