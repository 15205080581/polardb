# Renewal {#concept_zrp_qkj_kgb .concept}

You can renew subscription clusters to prolong their subscription periods. Pay-as-you-go clusters are billed based on the actual usage and never expire. You do not need to renew pay-as-you-go clusters. You only need to ensure that your Alibaba Cloud account has sufficient balance.

## Fees {#section_ur5_rvp_52b .section}

The prices of renewed clusters are the same as those of newly created clusters. For more information, see [Specifications and pricing](intl.en-US/Pricing/Specifications and pricing.md#).

## Deduction time {#section_uh5_5vp_52b .section}

-   Auto renewal: Fees are first deducted at 08:00 on the ninth day before a subscription cluster expires. If the deduction failed, the system tries to deduct fees once a day until fees are deducted or the expiration date arrives. You need to ensure that your Alibaba Cloud account has sufficient balance. If your cluster expires tomorrow, renew the cluster manually.
-   Manual renewal: Pay manually if you want to renew a subscription cluster.
