3.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Purchases record** \> **Purchases details**.
4.  Click the Cloud products tab.
5.  Click the Details of bill records tab.
6.  Click the Pre-payment tab or the Post-payment tab. The following table describes the specific billing items on the two tabs.

    |Tab|Billing item|
    |---|------------|
    |**Post-payment**|     -   The fees paid for each pay-as-you-go cluster.
    -   The additional fees paid for each subscription or pay-as-you-go cluster, including the fees of the storage and SQL explorer.
 |
    |**Pre-payment**|The fees paid for each subscription cluster.|

7.  Set filter criteria as needed and click **Query**.

    **Note:** 

    -   **Account period** refers to the time when a bill is generated but not the time when a service is used. For example, if you used a service at 23:00 on January 31 and the bill was generated at 01:00 on February 1, the account period of this service PO is in February.
    -   Currently, you can query data only within a natural month. You cannot select a time range that spans several natural months. For example, you cannot select a time range from February 10, 2018 to March 10, 2018. If you want to query data that was generated more than 12 months ago, open a ticket.
