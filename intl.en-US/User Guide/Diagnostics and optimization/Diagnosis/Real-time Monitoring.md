# Real-time Monitoring

This topic describes the diagnosis feature provided by PolarDB for MySQL. The diagnosis feature integrates with Database Autonomy Service \(DAS\) and allows you to use the real-time monitoring feature to monitor the queries per second \(QPS\), transactions per second \(TPS\), and network traffic transmitted through a cluster.

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the [PolarDB console](https://polardb.console.aliyun.com/).

2.  On the top of the page, select the region where the target cluster is located.

3.  On the **Clusters** page, click the ID of the target cluster.

4.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Diagnostics and Optimization** \> **Diagnosis**.

5.  On the **Real-time Monitoring** page, you can view performance details, such as the server information and buffer pool information about different nodes in the cluster.

    **Note:** You can click **Metric Description** to view detailed descriptions of parameters.
